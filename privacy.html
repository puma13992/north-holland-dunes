        <!--General information and mandatory information-->
        <h2>3. General information and mandatory information</h2>
        <h3>Data protection</h3>
        <p>The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously.
            Hence, we handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory
            data protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration. Whenever you use this website,
            a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to
            personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we collect as well as
            the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.
            We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e., through e-mail communications)
            may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third-party access.
        </p>
        <h3>Information about the responsible party (referred to as the &ldquo;controller&rdquo; in the GDPR)</h3>
        <p>The data processing controller on this website is:
            Sarah Topfst&auml;dt<br>
            Sierichstr. 154<br>
            22299 Hamburg
            Phone: +49 (0)40 74 39 73 69<br>
            E-mail: sarah.topfstaedt@avinus.de
            The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes
            decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail
            addresses, etc.).
        </p>
        <h3>Storage duration</h3>
        <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data
            will remain with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies.
            If you assert a justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be
            deleted,
            unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data
            (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after
            these reasons cease to apply.
        </p>
        <h3>General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website</h3>
        <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a)
            GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO.
            In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is
            also based on
            Art. 49 (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your
            end device
            (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on &sect; 25 (1) TTDSG.
            The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for
            the
            implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
            Furthermore, if your
            data is required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.
            Furthermore,
            the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f)
            GDPR. Information
            on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy
            policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries</h3>
        <p>Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United States or other from a data protection
            perspective
            non-secure non-EU countries. If these tools are active, your personal data may potentially be transferred to
            these non-EU countries
            and may be processed there. We must point out that in these countries, a data protection level that is
            comparable to that in the
            EU cannot be guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to release personal data to the
            security agencies and
            you as the data subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot be
            ruled out that
            U.S. agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your personal data
            for surveillance purposes.
            We have no control over these processing activities.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
        <p>A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent.
            You can also revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to
            the lawfulness
            of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21
            GDPR)</h3>
        <p>IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY
            TIME OBJECT
            TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO
            APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING
            BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE
            CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION
            DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE
            IN A POSITION TO PRESENT
            COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS
            AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE
            PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT
            TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
            IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
            OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING
            OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
            PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT
            IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER
            BE USED FOR DIRECT
            ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).
        </p>
        <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
        <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory
            agency, in particular
            in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where the
            alleged violation occurred.
            The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court proceedings
            available as legal recourses.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
        <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment
            of a contract handed
            over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you should demand the direct
            transfer of the data to another
            controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
        <p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to demand information about your
            archived personal data,
            their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data at any time. You may also
            have a right to have your
            data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about
            personal data, please do not
            hesitate to contact us at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
        <p>You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is
            concerned.
            To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the
            following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need
                some time to
                verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that
                we restrict the
                processing of your personal data.
            </li>
            <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to
                demand the restriction
                of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.
            </li>
            <li>If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
                entitlements,
                you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its
                eradication.
            </li>
            <li>If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be
                weighed against each other.
                As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand a
                restriction of the processing
                of your personal data.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data &ndash; with the exception of their
            archiving &ndash;
            may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to
            protect the rights of other
            natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a
            member state of the EU.
        </p>
        <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
            inquiries you submit to
            us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize
            an encrypted connection
            by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to
            &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the
            appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.</p>
        <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot
            be read by third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3>
        <p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name,
            request)
            will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these data on
            without your consent.
            These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of
            a contract or is
            required for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the data are processed on the
            basis of our legitimate
            interest in the effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on the basis of your
            consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)
            if it has been obtained; the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
        <p>The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain
            with us until you request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data
            storage lapses
            (e.g. after completion of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention
            periods -
            remain unaffected.
